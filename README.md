Moira 2.0 is a completely rewritten version of:

1. Checker and API services in Go (instead of Python), based on [carbonapi](https://github.com/go-graphite/carbonapi) implementation.
2. Web service in React, with slightly different UI.

Code in this repository is a backend part of Moira monitoring application. Frontend part is [here][web2].

Documentation for the entire Moira project is available on [Read the Docs][readthedocs] site.
